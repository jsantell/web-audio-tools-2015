## Abstract

As technologies evolve and mature, proper tooling is needed to increase adoption and combat complexity, and web audio is no exception.

An overture on the state of web audio tools, we will explore using both browser developer tools that take advantage of privileged platform code, and cross-browser drop-in libraries to provide introspection of the state of an audio context and nodes. With these tools, we’ll cover common debugging scenarios like audio graph construction, node-to-node signal transformations, signal visualizations, garbage collection, and resource consumption. These tools can help beginners understand a complex new API, save a developer’s time debugging, and help browser implementers optimize their platform.

Attendees will leave with the knowledge of what tools are out there, workflows for inspecting, fixing, and optimizing a web audio environment, and how to make their own tools for a specific use case.
